# Procedural-Terrain-Generation
 The Unity project folder for my terrain generation project.
 
 This project consists of a seeded voxel terrain generation algorithm based on the Perlin Noise function.
 
 <b>Features Include:</b>
 - Infinite procedural generation.
 - Terrain saving.
 - Terrain voxel manipulation (editable terrain at runtime).
 - 3D Terrain visualization.
 
 You can find the majority of the original source code in /Assets/Scripts/...
 
 Credit to Heikki Törmälä for his C# implementation of Perlin Noise which I used for this project.
