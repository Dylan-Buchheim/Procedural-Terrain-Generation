# Procedural-Terrain_Generation
 The Unity project folder for my terrain generation project.
 
 This project consists of a seeded voxel terrain generation algorithm based on the Perlin Noise function.
 
 Features Include:
 - Infinite procedural generation.
 - Terrain saving.
 - Terrain voxel manipulation (editable terrain at runtime).
 - 3D Terrain visualization.
